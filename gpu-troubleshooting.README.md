## ⚔️ Opening the Box

Opening the box was a thrill. Out with the old 1080p 60Hz monitor from 2020 — back before I was even a full professor. I know that 1440p at 100Hz isn't a *huge* leap, but it felt like glory. And it was such a great deal. I don’t pay thousands for a screen — because I can’t. I have no money, no job, and no prospects.

Yes, this once Chair of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Business at a full-time university is now unemployed.  
Except... for that shiny new screen that cost less than my last birthday gift: $200.

With all the wires set, and a new graphics card installed (which itself cost less than my line of credit), I fired it up.

**Those bastards.**  
It’s got to be NVIDIA. Or wait — look, Intel is leeching on.  
I will kill them all.

Out with NVIDIA — completely. Not even an icon left. Help me destroy everything NVIDIA.  
Then, let’s blacklist Intel, that old bastard.

> “Why does it even exist?!”

Fine. Let’s get wild. Let’s mess with GRUB. What was it called?  
**initramfs**? Sounds dangerous.

## 🌀 Down the Rabbit Hole

This novice clearly had some crazy ideas.  
ChatGPT went with the madness — *up to a point.* Thankfully, it convinced me not to destroy the GRUB or initramfs.

Three days of bitching, hunting down stray NVIDIA files, blacklisting Intel, and fighting with monitor detection...  
We wrote scripts. We made logs. We circled the drain.

Then, it hit me.

It wasn’t the GPUs. It was the damn **monitor**.

Turns out it would power off when the PC turned on and stay off — until I unplugged it and plugged it back in. A novice mistake? Maybe. But how many times do we try to force something we *want* when it just isn’t possible?

## 💔 The Open Box Curse

So, I gave up. I boxed it up. I returned the dream.  
And then...

I put my old 1080p monitor back on the desk.  
The same one from before all this began.

And you know what?  
It’s **good enough for me.**

Maybe not forever. Maybe not for everyone.  
But for now — in this chapter of rebuilding, learning, and searching — it’ll do.
