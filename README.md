# Linux Apprenticeship with AI

This is a living record of a self-directed Linux apprenticeship guided by ChatGPT (AI), showcasing an evolving journey in Linux system administration, security hardening, desktop customization, and creative scripting.

## 🔍 What This Project Is
An experimental, transparent, and creative learning experience blending:
- Fedora KDE system setup and recovery
- Sysctl tuning and kernel hardening
- Display and GPU configuration (NVIDIA → AMD transition)
- Bash scripting with systemd user services
- Medieval-themed UI design and splash screen animation
- Custom startup automation and terminal effects
- Resume generation using LaTeX, icons, and Linux-native tools

## 📂 Project Structure
- `resume/`: LaTeX resume + build script
- `scripts/`: Display configs, splash screen toggles, startup automation
- `systemd/`: (Coming soon) User service files
- `notes_journal/`: (Optional) Progress journal or config logs

## 🧙 Who Did This?
Douglas K. Childers, Ph.D. — applied mathematician and Linux adventurer.  
ChatGPT — AI co-mentor, shieldsman, and companion scribe.

## 🚀 Goals
- Show that a self-taught Linux path is viable and creative
- Build and document real tools, configs, and startup scripts
- Inspire others to try building with AI instead of just asking it questions

> This is more than a resume — it's a story.
