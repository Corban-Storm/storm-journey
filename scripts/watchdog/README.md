üß© ChatGPT Challenge: "Guardian of the Logs"
Objective: Build a script that watches system logs in real-time and alerts you when suspicious behavior happens (e.g. failed logins, sudo attempts, kernel warnings, USB mounts, etc.)
üîç Why This Rocks
    ‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll learn how to tap into journalctl, dmesg, and log monitoring.
    ‚Ä¢ It's practical sysadmin knowledge (real-world skills).
    ‚Ä¢ You can integrate it with email, notifications, or a text file log.
    ‚Ä¢ You could later pipe it into a fancy dashboard or CLI report.
  

ü™ì Base Challenge (Level 1 ‚Äì Apprentice Blacksmith):
Write a Bash script that:
    ‚Ä¢ Monitors journalctl -f for:
        ‚ó¶ Failed password
        ‚ó¶ sudo
        ‚ó¶ usb or mount
        ‚ó¶ Any line containing error or warning
    ‚Ä¢ Appends alerts to a file like ~/security.log and others log files

    The assignment was by ChatGPT but I finally did my own script today!
