# Z-hardened.conf Evolution Notes

This directory contains different versions of the `Z-hardened.conf` file used to harden the Linux system via sysctl.

## 📜 Z-hardenedold.conf

This was the **initial attempt** at sysctl hardening. It was built based on fragmented advice from online sources, and in hindsight had several issues:
- Some settings were blindly copied without understanding their purpose
- One or more parameters may have increased kernel dump verbosity, which was **counterproductive for security**
- It reflected a phase of exploration and trial — useful as a learning artifact

## 🛡️ Z-hardened.conf

The current version, pulled from `/etc/sysctl.d/Z-hardened.conf`, represents a much more informed and focused approach:
- Emphasis on **realistic and effective hardening** (BPF lockdown, address space randomization, etc.)
- Tweaks based on logs, system behavior, and ChatGPT-guided explanation of each value
- Cleaned up invalid or redundant parameters

This version reflects **applied understanding**, not just copy/paste — part of an evolving Linux security practice.

> These files document the path from "novice copying configs" to "beginner sysadmin making conscious choices."
