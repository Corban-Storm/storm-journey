Here lies my soul. Some of it contains stories of my journey learning linux. That's the journal side of my life. I like to think this folder is a small view of my raw self right now. The other side of raw is my poetry.
It's mostly dark. I've never shared it. 

I believe the world is beautiful, but without the dark we would not appreciate the light. Still, life sucks
and then you die. So take it as you will but be kind to yourself. And me.
